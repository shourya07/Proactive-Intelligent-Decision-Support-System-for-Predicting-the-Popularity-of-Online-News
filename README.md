# Proactive-Intelligent-Decision-Support-System-for-Predicting-the-Popularity-of-Online-News

Hi Guys, I'm continuing my course project work. As a group project we were supposed to build a predictive model for our Business Intelligence- Data mining class. I continued to work a bit further and constructed 3 models. The first model is prepared, but I'm still continuing on the 2 models which involves Clustering, ETL and Text semantics analysis.
Hope to get your continued support for the same.
